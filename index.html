    <h1>GIT</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system(DVCS), meaning it keeps track of changes 
        in your files and allows you to revert to previous versions if needed </p>
        <p>Git Workflow- Local Repository</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You make changes to your files in the <b>working directory</b></li>
            <li>You then <b>stage</b> the specific changes you want to keep for the next 
            version</li>
            <li>Finally you <b>commit</b> the staged changes, creating a new snapshot in your local
            repository </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Branching:</b> Git allows you to create branches of your project, essentially creating
        temporary copies to work on specific features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.
        Once you are happy with your changes in a branch you can merge them back into the main branch 
    </p>
